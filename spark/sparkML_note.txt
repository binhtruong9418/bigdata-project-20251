SPARK ML - PYTHON 3.11 COMPATIBILITY
====================================

✅ FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH PYTHON 3.11

sparkML.py reads real data from Cassandra and trains a Random Forest model
to predict house prices based on features like location, size, and amenities.

WHAT WORKS WITH PYTHON 3.11:
- ✅ Kafka Producer generating real-time data
- ✅ Batch Consumer saving to HDFS
- ✅ Spark Streaming with real-time aggregations
- ✅ Batch processing from HDFS to Cassandra
- ✅ Cassandra integration (cassandra-driver fully supported)
- ✅ ML model training with PySpark MLlib
- ✅ Random Forest Regressor for price prediction
- ✅ Feature engineering and data preprocessing

WORKFLOW:
1. Start pipeline: .\start.bat (or ./start.sh)
2. Wait for data collection (10-15 minutes)
3. Load to Cassandra: python spark/batch_processing.py
4. Verify data: python check_cassandra_data.py
5. Train ML model: python spark/sparkML.py

ML MODEL FEATURES:
- Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
- Target: House price prediction
- Features: city, hometype, bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, lot size, etc.
- Training/Test Split: 80/20
- Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, R², MAE

CASSANDRA INTEGRATION:
- Keyspace: finaldata1
- Table: data2
- Connection: localhost:9042
- Data source: Real streaming data from Kafka pipeline

TESTED ENVIRONMENT:
- Python 3.11.x
- PySpark 4.0.1
- cassandra-driver (fully compatible)
- Windows 10/11, Linux, MacOS
- All components working correctly
